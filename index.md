👩🏽‍💻 By Fatima Iqbal and Team  
St. John’s University – CYB 625 Final Project  

## 🔍 Overview  
Forensic scripts are essential for audits, investigations, and digital accountability. Our project focused on designing secure, policy-compliant PowerShell and Python scripts with NIST SP 800-53 alignment.

## 💡 Research Highlights  
- 📜 Scripts: PowerShell & Python with logging
- 🧪 Static Analysis Tools: PSScriptAnalyzer & Bandit
- 🧾 Compliance: User Consent, Secure Storage, Data Minimization
- 📂 Logs: Timestamped, readable, auditable

## 🔒 Methodology  
Scripts were written and evaluated with ethical and legal concerns in mind. Static analysis revealed low-severity but critical improvements.
